# Drop Neo4j — progress log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. **Never rewrite an earlier entry** —
if one turns out to be wrong, add a correcting entry that says so.

Each entry carries: date, phase, what landed, files touched, tests added,
Done-criteria met or explicitly not met, and what's next.

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the phase definitions and their Done criteria, and
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for anything that deviated from the plan.

## 2026-08-11 — Phase 0 — docs landed

**What landed:** `docs/refactor/drop-neo4j/` created with `PLAN.md` (the
approved plan, verbatim apart from the self-reference in "This plan lives in
the repo"), plus `PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `SCHEMA.md` stubs. Pointer
added to `README.md`; `CLAUDE.md` gained a line directing future sessions here
before touching `gsf/dal/` or `gsf/catalog/`.

**Files touched:** `docs/refactor/drop-neo4j/{PLAN,PROGRESS,DECISIONS,SCHEMA}.md`,
`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

**Tests added:** none — documentation only.

**Done criteria:** `docs/refactor/drop-neo4j/` exists and is linked from
`README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — **met**. The other two Phase 0 criteria
(`reserved_words` severed, surface test green) are **not yet met**; they are
the remaining Phase 0 work.

**Next:** create `gsf/catalog/constants.py` and repoint the ~29
`reserved_words` imports.
